# CS 212: Project 1B

Assignment: Create a script that will create a directory structure, and files within that directory structure, all with the specified file permissions. The files should contain the specified contents. The script should be named “proj1B” exactly. (A consistent name will help with grading.)  

Note: you are only allowed to use the following commands: cd, chmod, cp, echo, mkdir, mv, rm, rmdir, touch. (You do not need to use all of these commands to complete the assignment successfully.) 

This is the directory structure you should make:
